# webcam2syphon
Simple openFrameworks app to grab frames from a webcam and publish them on syphon for other apps to use

# setup
- Look at `mySettings.xml` in the `data` folder for initial settings including capture dimensions
- build it yourself with openFrameworks 0.98 (requires `ofxSyphon` and `ofxXmlSettings`) or download a release
- use [Simple Client](https://github.com/Syphon/Simple) to test
